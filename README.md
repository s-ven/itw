# Interview code challenges 

## Checkout terminal 

In this test we look at:
- General knowledge of Groovy programming
- How the candidate solves the problem. Is the candidate able to break up the problem into smaller problems and solve them one by one, or does he go for a "brute force" way of solving it. 
- Does the candidate use tests to come to the final result
- Algorithmic problem solving. 

## Message validator

This is usually the second coding challenge we give to a candidate. This test is different in the way that the candidate is given an existing code base and asked to extend it and solve a problem. In this test we look at:
- General knowledge of Groovy programming
- How the candidate solves the problem
- How the candidate is able to understand and get familiar with an existing code base and constraints
- Understanding of Java / Groovy generics
- Understanding of functional programming patterns

# How to

- These are Grooovy coding challenge, the implementation language MUST be Grooovy
- Each of the challenge must be done in a separate pull request.
- The pull request needs to as descriptive as possible

# Nice to have

- [Picocli CLI](https://picocli.info/) app for each of the challenges
- Migrate the two gradle projects into a single multi module one
- Implement static analysis code (eg. Codenarc, ...)
